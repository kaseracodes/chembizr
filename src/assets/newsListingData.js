      "The ACME Group and the Japanese IHI Corporation have formalized an agreement for the export of green ammonia from India to Japan. The outlined terms encompass the provision of 0.4 million metric tons per annum (MMTPA) of green ammonia sourced from the Gopalpur project in Odisha, currently under development by ACME. The Gopalpur project is going to have a total capacity of 1.2 MMTPA, with initial production anticipated by 2027. Throughout its operational lifespan, this initiative is projected to contribute to a reduction of 54 million tons of CO2 equivalent in global greenhouse gas emissions. The collaborative effort underscores the commitment to fostering sustainable energy trade between the two countries and the favorable cost-competitiveness of green ammonia generation in India.",
